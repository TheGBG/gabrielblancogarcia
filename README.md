### About me

I'm a Data Science passionate. I have a degree in bussines administration, but after getting interested in DS, and after studying a master in it, I discovered my true passion. I love statistics, ML, DL, and everything that has to do with prediction. But I also like cleaning and parsing data, web scraping, and small bots to automate tasks.

The main languages and tools I know and use are:
- Python 
- R
- Git and Git Hub (seems obvious here lol)
- Docker
- SQL
- Spark

I also like using the command line, mainly PowerShell, or Bash through WSL.

Some of the fields I have knowledge in are:
- Machine Learning: both supervised and unsupervised learning
- Statistics
- Data Analysis in general
- NLP
- Data wrangling & cleanning
- Dimensionality reduction
- Financial analysis
- Economics

And, beyond the endless list of stuff I'm looking forward to learn or dive deeper are:
- More statistics, specifically bayesian
- Deep Learning, specially generative (GAN's) 
- Reinforcment Learning
- Robotics
- Software in general, automate stuff, and alike
