### About me

I'm a Data Science passionate. I have a degree in bussines administration, but after getting interested in DS, and after studying a master in it, I discovered my true passion. I love statistics, ML, DL, and everything that has to do with prediction. But I also like cleaning and parsing data, web scraping, and small bots to automate tasks.

The main languages and tools I know:
- Python 
- R
- Docker
- SQL
- Spark

I also like using the command line, mainly PowerShell, or Bash through WSL.
